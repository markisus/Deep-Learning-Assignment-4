# Comments on your code
I like how you just load the core for model validation, shows your understanding.
No need to keep working with tensors of size 20
Dont see right away where's the bug leading to your terrible perplexity.

# Comments on your write-up
Unrolling for just 10 timesteps seems like a bad idea, you need to be able to propagate gradient for longer.
2 epochs is just too short training.
